controllers - home, account, category, and recipe (delete ingredients and steps)
models - appUser, category, recipe, categoryrecipe, context, and DesignDB (delete categoryItem, item, and recipeingredient)

category - name (its type of food)
recipe - name(can leave as description if we don't want to change stuff), ingredients, instructions, possibly a rating


so it should work, maybe
the views probably don't work bc we changed wha
